# Prims_Algorithm
Implementation of Prim's minimun spanning tree algorithm  in a Monte Carlo generated graph
# Description
 Prim's (also known as Jarn√≠k's) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted
 undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the 
 total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time,
 from an arbitrary starting vertex,  at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.
 
 This code is uses a class graph and a class priority queue made from scratch.
